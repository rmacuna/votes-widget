# UI widget to display the Carousel of votes of famous people

This is how the project was created.

I used react to create a component for the given exercise. 

If you want to run the component alone and test it you just need to run the following commands

```
 yarn install
 yarn start
```

(.env variables are not included locally)

If you want to see the full component integrated with the website, you can go to the `/website` folder and open the index.html. I'm using and iframe so you should be able to see it in action.

Thank you very much.

## Possible improvements.

- For the speed of development there are some DRY code in the
  StyledComponents

- Adding unit testing could be an awesome improvement.

- There are some logic in the code like the click outside function that can be moved into a hook for possible reusage.
